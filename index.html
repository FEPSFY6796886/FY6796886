      This paper will give an overview of the use of wearable technology in the medical profession. 
      Wearable technology is a health monitoring device and has the potential to provide people with
      more advanced information and continuous medical data in real time regarding their health,
      helping people to make better choices with their lifestyle, diagnosis and treatment.

      To what extent will wearable technology aid in early detection of illnesses?
      Wearable Technology has the capabilities to transform the way we diagnose diseases and
      illnesses, and prognosis of a disease through intervention from an early stage, providing a cost-
      effective solution through means of prediction and prevention of a disease effectively before it
      progresses to later stages of the disease where it requires more medical care and treatment.

      Wearable Technology include wearable sensors which are capable of measuring physiological
      signs such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), heart rate (HR), body
      temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood pressure
      (BP) and respiration rate (RR)(Pantelopoulos and Bourbakis, 2010; Nemati, Deen and Mondal, 2012
      as cited in Majumder, Mondal and Deen, 2017).They can be comfortably placed on the epidermis, inserted
      through the skin or body orifices for measuring electrophysiological or biochemical signals, and 
      delivering drugs(Khan et al, 2016 as cited in Yetisen et al, 2018). Such technologies when incorporated
      in garments, accessories, or epidermal surface to provide electronic alerts, sense physical and biochemical 
      information, or deliver drugs are broadly called medical wearables (Zeng et al, 2014; Yetisen et al, 2016
      as cited in Yetisen et al, 2018).

      Wearable devices have pattern recognition features so they can spot connections to various
      diseases, which can then be further analysed to produce a more accurate diagnosis. It also gives
      continuous real-time data, so if any abnormalities or problems arise in an individual body, it can
      be quickly and effectively detected. It is especially important and useful for our increasingly
      elderly generation because it reduces their consistent visits and difficulties going to clinics and
      hospital due to their old age where mobility might be an issue, so wearable devices offer a 
      great solution to that problem since their health can be continuously monitored from the comfort of their homes.

        We will study an article where it discusses how wearables devices can be used for early
        detection of Parkinsonâ€™s disease which affects a big proportion our elderly generation.
