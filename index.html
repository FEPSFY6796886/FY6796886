      This paper will give an overview of the use of wearable technology in the medical profession. 
      Wearable technology is a health monitoring device and has the potential to provide people with
      more advanced information and continuous medical data in real time regarding their health,
      helping people to make better choices with their lifestyle, diagnosis and treatment.

      To what extent will wearable technology aid in early detection of illnesses?
      Wearable Technology has the capabilities to transform the way we diagnose diseases and
      illnesses, and prognosis of a disease through intervention from an early stage, providing a cost-
      effective solution through means of prediction and prevention of a disease effectively before it
      progresses to later stages of the disease where it requires more medical care and treatment.

      Wearable Technology include wearable sensors which are capable of measuring physiological
      signs such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), heart rate (HR), body
      temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood pressure
      (BP) and respiration rate (RR). They can be comfortably placed on the epidermis, inserted
      through the skin or body orifices for measuring electrophysiological or biochemical signals, and 
      delivering drugs. Such technologies when incorporated in garments, accessories, or epidermal
      surface to provide electronic alerts, sense physical and biochemical information, or deliver
      drugs are broadly called medical wearables. Wearable devices have the potential to offer
      features such as augmented, virtual, and mixed reality, artificial intelligence, and pattern recognition.
